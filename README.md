# ePayApp
The task is to create an backend application that provides a set of APIs to be called from a frontend UI.
# API Requirements
The API will have 4 endpoints and will communicate JSON with at least the following functionality for each end point:

* /login -  a POST request that will accept no input and return a token (which need to be used in subsequent calls to the API, in the Authorization header). Every call  to /login will return a new token and every invocation to this endpoint creates a new user, gives them a preset balance in a preset currency. 

* /balance -  a GET request that will accept an Authorization header (with the token value output from /login) and  will return the current balance along with the currency code.

* /transactions - a GET request that will accept an Authorization header (with the token value output from /login) and  will return a list of transactions done by the user with atleast the date, description, amount, currency for each transaction.

* /spend - a POST request that will accept an Authorization header (with the token value output from /login), JSON content representing one spend transaction with the transaction date, description, amount, currency.

* /update/profile - a POST request that will accept an Authorization header (with the token value output from /login),  input parameter  content representing user name, email, mobile number, gender and other details.

* /recharge/wallet - a POST request that will accept an Authorization header (with the token value output from /login),  input parameter  content representing amount to be added, with currency and other optional detail like coupan code, remark etc.

# Technology stack

* Used Java and related framework (JPA,Spring,Hibernate,Spring Rest etc) and postgres for the database. 
* Used Memcache for caching frequently used data, Application build using Tomcat server, However any other server can also be used.

the backend will run as a standalone java process. 

# Tutorial

* Setting Database Configuration
  + Create a db in postgres, and enter the db details like userName, password and db name in persistence.properties file as shown below

    jdbc.username=abc   
    jdbc.password=***   
    jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dbNamne?autoReconnect=true&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-   8&connectionCollation=utf8_unicode_ci&characterSetResults=UTF-8   
    jdbc.database=POSTGRESQL  
    jdbc.driver.classname=org.postgresql.Driver   
    jdbc.show.sql=false   
    jdbc.generate.ddl=true  
    hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=10000   
    jdbc.database.platform=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect  
  
* Configuring Memcache
  + install and start memcache server, the memcache host and port need to be entered in memcached.properties file, as shown below.              MEMCACHED_SERVERS=localhost:11211
  
*  API's
   + Request
    curl -X POST -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -H "Postman-Token: c43da818-b4aa-1b39-31ae-e63e7d4783d4" "{{host}}/epayApp/api/v1/login"
    API is responsible for creating a new user, and adding some preset balance to the user Account. It simply returns the token which       can be used in subsequent API calls for retrieving user details and other info. sample token response is mentioned below.
